# motif-mark

###Goal:
- Develop a python script to plot protein binding motifs on an image of an exon and flanking introns

###Contents in repository:
- Reference `Motif_mark.pdf` for the lecture and context behind the assignment.
- Python script `Motif_mark.py` which requires two files to be passed as parameters `-f` and `-m`
- `-f` is in the format of a fasta file `sequences.fasta`
- `-m` is a required text file of motifs, one per line `motifs.txt`

###Assignment:
- Requirements:
  - Python3 compatible
  - Use argparse
  - Input FASTA file and motifs file
  - Multiple sequences
  - Multiple motifs
  - Ambiguous motif handling
  - svg output
  - Key/labeling
